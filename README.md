# Advancing Chest Abnormality Detection  
## Using Deep Learning Innovations for Enhanced Diagnostic Precision  

This project proposes a hybrid **Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN)** for detecting and assessing multiple diseases using **CT scans and Lung X-rays**. By integrating **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) layers** with classical CNNs, it leverages **quantum computing** for enhanced accuracy and generalization.  

Trained on a diverse dataset covering **COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis**, the model outperforms traditional CNNs in both **disease classification and severity assessment**, aiding clinical decision-making. This approach improves **diagnostic precision** and offers insights into **disease progression**, advancing medical imaging and healthcare.
