# ADVANCING CHEST ABNORMALITY DETECTION 
USING DEEP LEARNING INNOVATIONS FOR 
ENHANCED DIAGNOSTIC PRECISION

This project proposes a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) for detecting and assessing multiple diseases using CT scans and Lung X-rays. By integrating Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) layers with classical CNNs, it leverages quantum computing for enhanced accuracy and generalization. Trained on a diverse dataset covering COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis, the model outperforms traditional CNNs in both disease classification and severity assessment, aiding clinical decision-making. This approach improves diagnostic precision and offers insights into disease progression, advancing medical imaging and healthcare.
